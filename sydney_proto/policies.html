        <h2>Studio Policies</h2>

        <p>By submitting payment, you reserve a spot in my studio for the year and agree to respect and abide by the studio policies.</p>

        <h3>Schedule</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>The studio year runs from September to June.  We will break for 2 weeks at Christmas and 1 week during Spring Break.</li>
            <li>We will have at least two recitals: at Christmas and in the spring.</li>
            <li>If the student must miss a lesson due to illness or a family emergency, please contact the teacher by phone or e-mail as soon as possible, preferably in advance. One week is reserved at the end of the year for make-up lessons.</li>
            <li>The teacher reserves the right to offer make-up lessons outside of that week on a case-by-case basis, but is under no obligation to do so.</li>
            <li>If the teacher must miss a lesson, the lesson will be rescheduled or refunded.</li>
            <li>If the student wishes to take lessons for a partial year, please contact me to work out payment and scheduling details. I have a limited number of spaces available for this type of tuition.</li>
            <li>For online lessons, the lesson will be rescheduled if the online connection cannot be established within 5 minutes of the lesson time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Payment</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Lesson Fees for the semester must be paid in advance (by the first of the month): You may pay by cheque, cash, or e-transfer. If you need to make alternate payment arrangements, please discuss that with me before payment is due.</li>
            <li>A $20 late fee will apply to all lesson and other fees. The teacher reserves the right to apply or waive the fee based on the payment history of the account in question.</li>
            <li>Please make all checks payable to Sydney Victor. The payee will be responsible for any NSF cheque fees incurred.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Lesson Rates</h3>

        <p>The teacher reserves the right to raise tuition at the beginning of each year.</p>
