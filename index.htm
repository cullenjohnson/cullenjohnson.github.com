          <h3>üëã About Me</h3>
          <p>
            With over 11 years of professional experience writing software, I have been able to successfully deliver
            quality coding solutions for a wide variety of industry verticals. I have had many incredible opportunities
            to work with and learn from some truly talented software engineers. My objective is to find a
            long&hyphen;term position where I can grow professionally and support my growing family by providing
            businesses with code that passes the standard of excellence!
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm a pretty easygoing guy. I smile a lot and genuinely mean it. I believe listening is one of the most
            important pieces of communication. I also believe that an important part of teamwork is not lashing out when
            things don't go my way or falling apart when I get disappointing news. One of my goals in a job is to
            be an effective communicator and positive collaborator.
          </p>
          <h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Code Experience</h3>
          <p>
            My experience showcases a versatile background in backend, frontend, and full-stack development across
            diverse roles. My expertise spans backend technologies like Java, Spring, GraphQL, and RESTful APIs, which
            I have applied extensively in my recent work to design and implement scalable microservices, manage
            technical debt, and support critical business functions. I have also worked on frontend development, using
            React.js and JavaScript for customer-facing applications that featured data visualization tools and
            interactive UI components. Additionally, my experience includes full-stack responsibilities where I have
            integrated backend functionality for a React frontend and managed cloud infrastructure with AWS. I'm familiar
            with most of the standard tools of the trade (Git, Jira, Confluence, IntelliJ, VS Code, bash shells, etc.)
            I'm thankful to have a broad range of experience that makes me a skilled, multifaceted developer ready to
            tackle your business' complex software projects.

          <h3>üå≤ Outside of Work</h3>
          <p>
            When I'm not working, I happily keep myself busy spending time with my wife Sydney, my children (we have one
            toddler son with a second baby on the way!), and with my church family. I live in beautiful British Columbia,
            so I try not to waste opportunities to get outside and enjoy the forests, beaches, and trails in my area. I
            also enjoy restoring and occasionally playing older video game consoles. I also enjoy playing chess (badly)!
